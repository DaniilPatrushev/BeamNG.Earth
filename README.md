# BeamNG.Earth

A 1:1 scale, streamed Earth for [BeamNG.drive](https://www.beamng.com/): drive anywhere on the
planet on real elevation data and satellite imagery, with distance-based level of detail and the
real curvature of the Earth.

Status: beta (see VERSION). Tested on BeamNG.drive 0.39.4 on Linux (Vulkan). See
[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for what is coming (high-speed streaming, real view distance,
roads, water, navigation, traffic, cities).

## Features (working today)
**The world**
- The whole planet at 1:1 scale on real elevation: national lidar where it exists (Mapterhorn: much of
  Europe, the US and more), Copernicus 30 m elsewhere with buildings and small tree stands filtered out of it.
- Aerial and satellite imagery on the ground: open state and national orthophotos (Maryland's 15 cm photos,
  a dozen more US states, NAIP across the US, Switzerland, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany's states,
  Austria, Japan, parts of Australia and Canada, and more), Sentinel-2 cloudless everywhere else; shadows and
  colour seams taken out of the photos, the season's colours graded in, cliffs drawn as rock.
- A real view distance out to the horizon, with the Earth's curvature.
- Ground materials from land cover (grass, dirt, rock, sand, snow, mud, lawns, paved squares and parking
  lots) with 3D grass and bushes.
- Trees and forests from a canopy height model, regional species (conifers, broadleaf, palms, desert
  shrubs), autumn colours in season.
- Buildings from Overture / OpenStreetMap with regional styles (US siding and brick, Alpine chalets, Nordic
  wood, Mediterranean stucco, East Asian and Latin American looks), real heights, roofs, windows, shopfronts,
  porches, churches with steeples, glass towers, far-away buildings drawn as a skyline.
- Roads as meshes with lane markings, sidewalks and curbs, curb ramps, storm drains, cobblestone streets,
  bridges with decks, traffic islands; the ground graded under them; street lights, utility poles with
  wires, traffic signals, stop signs and speed-limit signs (mph or km/h by country).
- Water: the sea with real depth (cars sink), lakes, and rivers kept beside the roads.
- Airports with graded, marked runways.

**Time, weather and physics**
- **Real time**: the sun, moon and stars are where they really are for the place, the date and the clock
  (the real time zone); the clock runs in real time. Change the time in the pause menu and the mod hands it
  over to you (switch back to Real any time).
- **Real weather** at the player from Open-Meteo, updated as you travel: cloud cover and high cirrus, clouds
  drifting with the wind aloft, fog from the real visibility, ground wind with gusts that pushes the cars,
  rain and snow, the air temperature, and the sun dimming under overcast. It goes through the game's own
  weather system, so the Time & Weather menu shows the real values; a manual mode leaves it to you.
- **Seasons**: the photos' colours and the trees' leaves follow the time of year (autumn colours, bare
  trees in winter where the photos were taken leaf-off).
- **Real gravity**: the WGS84 gravity for your latitude and altitude plus the EGM2008 local anomalies, so
  gravity really is weaker on a mountain or at the equator.

**Driving and traffic**
- Drive anywhere: the physics ground follows the car at 100+ mph, the world origin moves with you
  (floating origin), and the world streams ahead of you; you never fall out of the world.
- Buildings, sidewalks, curbs and bridge decks are solid (lean collision meshes near the car keep the
  physics' collision rebuilds cheap).
- Fast teleports: right after a teleport, while you wait, the world server may borrow some of the game's
  CPU cores (at idle priority) to build the world faster (Linux; `--load-boost off` turns it off).
- **AI support**: the mod builds BeamNG's road graph (the AI's map) from the real roads around you, with
  lanes, one-way streets, speed limits (mapped, or the country's defaults), the country's driving side and
  road rules, and traffic signals at real junctions. The stock AI, traffic, police and the AI modes in the
  vehicle menu work on it.
- **Traffic**: stock BeamNG traffic and police can be switched on, and parked cars line the streets and fill
  parking lots (stock BeamNG parking).

**Map and navigation**
- World map (**M**): pan and zoom the globe, satellite or street map (EOX) with a roads & labels overlay,
  borders and place names (the **Layers** button), search for addresses and places as you type, teleport
  anywhere.
- GPS routes to any destination (OSRM on OpenStreetMap), with the stock route arrows on the road.
- **Autodrive**: the car drives itself along the GPS route (in lane, legal speed, minding traffic).
- Saved places and recent places.

**Interface and tools**
- A slim status bar (street, town, country, world loading), a connection banner when something is
  wrong and the data credits on screen, as BeamNG UI apps in a ".Earth" app layout (based on Freeroam's;
  move or resize them in the UI apps editor), and a one-time welcome page about the project.
- Settings in the pause menu, keybinds, in-game reports (notes and performance recordings to share).
- Easy setup: `install.py` installs everything, `start.py` keeps the mod in sync and starts the server.
- Offline play from the download cache (with a size cap and "clear cache").
- Update check: the mod tells you in game (and on its settings page, with a link) when a newer version is on
  GitHub.

## How it works
- A small **companion server** (`server/`, Python) downloads elevation and imagery, builds terrain
  tiles in a local flat frame around a moving origin, and streams them to the game over a local
  socket. The game's Lua cannot reach the internet, so the server is required.
- The **mod** (`mod/beamng_earth/`) loads the tiles as meshes, keeps an invisible physics terrain
  under the car, moves the world origin as you drive (floating origin), and blends level-of-detail
  changes so nothing pops.
- Design and measurements: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md),
  [docs/V1_4_SPEC.md](docs/V1_4_SPEC.md), research notes in [docs/research/](docs/research/).

## Install and play
**You need:** BeamNG.drive (tested with 0.39.x) on Steam, free disk space for the map download cache (it grows
as you visit places, up to 20 GB by default; settings page > "Download cache size" sets 5-50 GB), and an internet
connection (the map is downloaded while you play).

1. **Download** the file for your system from the [Releases](https://github.com/TecnaGamer/BeamNG.Earth/releases)
   page:
   - **Windows:** `BeamNG.Earth-<version>.exe`. Windows may warn about an unknown app: **More info > Run anyway**.
   - **Linux:** `BeamNG.Earth-<version>-x86_64.AppImage`. Make it executable (right-click > Properties >
     "Allow executing", or `chmod +x`).
2. **Run it** (with Steam running). A console window opens (like BeamMP's launcher); it copies the mod into the
   game, starts the world server and starts BeamNG.drive. Closing the game stops the server.
   - **Linux, native game:** started with the grass patch (`tools/gcpatch`) already applied, no Steam launch
     options needed.
   - **Linux, Windows build under Proton:** the AppImage sees the Proton setting and starts that build through
     Steam (the server runs natively). The `.exe` also works inside the game's Proton prefix (for example with
     protontricks' launcher).
   - **Linux, Steam as a Flatpak (or snap):** the mod goes into the game's folder inside the Flatpak
     (`~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/...`) and the game starts through Steam (without the grass patch).
   - The Windows build shows BeamNG's launch options dialog (renderer, safe mode) as usual; `--gfx dx11` /
     `--gfx vk` / `--gfx dx12` skip it with that renderer.
3. **Play:** in the game, go to **Freeroam** and pick the **BeamNG.Earth** level. A welcome page explains the
   basics the first time. Press **M** for the world map: search a place or an address, right-click to teleport,
   left-click to set a GPS route, and **Autodrive** to let the car drive it.

**From the source instead** (any system with [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)): download this
project (the green **Code** button > **Download ZIP**) and unzip it. Install once (and after each update):
double-click `run_server.bat` (Windows) or run `python3 install.py` (Linux). Then start the server with
`run_server.bat` / `./run_server.sh`, keep its window open, and start the game yourself. Or run
`python3 launcher.py`, which also starts the game like the downloads do.

**Updating:** the mod tells you in game when a newer version is on GitHub. Download the new file and run it (from
the source: unzip it over the old folder and run the installer again).

**Uninstalling:** delete the `beamng_earth` folder in `<BeamNG user folder>/current/mods/unpacked/` and the
downloaded file (or this folder); the map cache is `.cache/beamng-earth` in your home folder (`~/.cache/beamng-earth` on Linux,
`C:\Users\<you>\.cache\beamng-earth` on Windows).

More detail (traffic, the status bar, reporting problems, troubleshooting): [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md).

### Developer setup
`python3 install.py` also works from a checkout (mod copy, `.venv`, then `python3 start.py`); by hand:
1. Python 3.10+ with the packages in `server/requirements.txt`.
2. Copy (or sync) `mod/beamng_earth/` to
   `<BeamNG user folder>/current/mods/unpacked/beamng_earth/`.
3. Start the server: `python3 server/earthd.py`
4. Start BeamNG.drive and load the **BeamNG.Earth** level. The mod connects to the server and
   streams the world; the status bar at the top shows where you are and the loading, **M** opens the
   world map (search, teleport, GPS routes, Autodrive).

Player downloads: `python3 tools/build_app.py` builds this system's AppImage / .exe (PyInstaller; see its
docstring; for the .exe run `tools/build_bootloader.py` first: a bootloader built from source, fewer antivirus
false positives); GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) builds both and publishes the release `v<VERSION>`
whenever `main` gets a `VERSION` without one. Release zip of the source: `python3 tools/package.py`.

Tests: `tools/test.sh` (the server's modules in parallel, the slow end-to-end ones left out; `--all` for every one,
or name modules: `tools/test.sh grading dsm`), or `cd server && python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"`, and
`cd mod/tests && for f in test_*.lua; do luajit $f; done`.
